<!---
It was the uneventful year of 2021, and armed only with a passion for RC field, Our founders decided to venture forth into the unknown world of boutique RC model field. Setting forth on a journey that, unbeknownst to him, would transform into a familial pillar within the community. RCHACKERS provides enthusiasts top-quality RC car kits, model kits, hopup parts, and accessories at the most reasonable prices.
We found that most players are looking for a generic product to avoid spending too much money when choosing. RCHACKERS was created to allow RC Racers to buy everything they need at one online site which offers low prices and excellent customer service.
From those early beginnings assembling packages in an unheated garage, we have grown into a tight-knit group of RC enthusiasts doing our absolute best to bring you great and unique products—Entry and enthusiast alike.
At RCHACKERS we love what we do, we take pride in what we make, and we firmly believe everyone should have access to an elevated experience.
